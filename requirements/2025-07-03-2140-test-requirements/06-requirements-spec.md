# Test Requirements Collection - Requirements Specification

**Project:** CHARM_INYEON AI 매칭 플랫폼  
**Feature:** Test Requirements Collection  
**Date:** 2025-07-03  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

## Problem Statement

The CHARM_INYEON platform needs a simple, user-friendly web interface for collecting test requirements from non-technical stakeholders. The current development process lacks a structured way to gather and document test requirements from product managers, QA teams, and other stakeholders who need to specify what should be tested without technical knowledge of the underlying test framework.

## Solution Overview

Create a standalone web interface that allows users to input, structure, and export test requirements in a simple form-based workflow. The interface will integrate seamlessly with the existing UI patterns and accessibility standards while providing file-based storage for easy sharing and documentation.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: User Interface
- **FR-1.1** Provide a clean, intuitive web form for entering test requirements
- **FR-1.2** Display requirements in a structured, organized format
- **FR-1.3** Support adding multiple test scenarios within a single collection session
- **FR-1.4** Include form validation to ensure required fields are completed
- **FR-1.5** Provide clear visual feedback for form errors and successful submissions

### FR-2: Data Collection
- **FR-2.1** Collect basic test information (title, description, priority)
- **FR-2.2** Support test scenario details (preconditions, steps, expected results)
- **FR-2.3** Allow categorization of test types (functional, security, performance, etc.)
- **FR-2.4** Enable specifying test environment requirements
- **FR-2.5** Support adding notes and additional context

### FR-3: Data Storage and Export
- **FR-3.1** Store collected requirements in JSON format
- **FR-3.2** Generate timestamp-based filenames following pattern: `test-requirements-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-sssZ.json`
- **FR-3.3** Provide instant download of collected requirements
- **FR-3.4** Include metadata (creation date, user session info, version)
- **FR-3.5** Support clearing form data after successful export

### FR-4: Accessibility and Usability
- **FR-4.1** Support senior-friendly accessibility features (large fonts, high contrast)
- **FR-4.2** Provide keyboard navigation support
- **FR-4.3** Include focus indicators for all interactive elements
- **FR-4.4** Support touch-friendly interaction (minimum 44px touch targets)
- **FR-4.5** Maintain responsive design for mobile and desktop use

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: Integration with Existing Codebase
- **TR-1.1** Use existing card pattern from `styles/components/cards.css`
- **TR-1.2** Implement form validation using patterns from `styles/components/forms.css`
- **TR-1.3** Follow accessibility patterns from `senior-ui.html`
- **TR-1.4** Use existing CSS custom properties system for theming
- **TR-1.5** Maintain consistency with existing Korean UI patterns

### TR-2: File Structure
- **TR-2.1** Create new HTML file: `test-requirements-collection.html`
- **TR-2.2** Use existing CSS files without modification
- **TR-2.3** Create minimal JavaScript file: `js/test-requirements.js`
- **TR-2.4** Follow existing file naming conventions

### TR-3: Data Format
- **TR-3.1** Export data in JSON format with the following structure:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "createdAt": "2025-07-03T21:40:00Z",
    "version": "1.0",
    "tool": "CHARM_INYEON Test Requirements Collection"
  },
  "requirements": [
    {
      "id": "req-001",
      "title": "Test Title",
      "description": "Test Description",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "category": "functional|security|performance|ui|integration",
      "preconditions": "Prerequisites",
      "steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"],
      "expectedResults": "Expected outcome",
      "environment": "test environment details",
      "notes": "Additional notes"
    }
  ]
}
```

### TR-4: Browser Compatibility
- **TR-4.1** Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **TR-4.2** Use standard HTML5 form elements
- **TR-4.3** Implement progressive enhancement for JavaScript features
- **TR-4.4** Ensure functionality without external dependencies

## Implementation Hints and Patterns

### UI Components to Use
- **Card Pattern:** Use `.card`, `.card-header`, `.card-content` for main container
- **Form Elements:** Use `.form-group`, `.form-label`, `.form-input`, `.form-error` classes
- **Button Styling:** Use `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-lg` for actions
- **Accessibility:** Include `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, and proper semantic HTML

### JavaScript Patterns
- **Form Handling:** Follow modal creation pattern from `script.js`
- **Data Export:** Use blob creation and download pattern for file generation
- **Validation:** Implement client-side validation with visual feedback
- **Accessibility:** Consider integration with text-to-speech features from `senior-ui.js`

### CSS Integration
- **Variables:** Use existing CSS custom properties for colors and spacing
- **Responsive:** Follow mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 768px
- **Typography:** Use existing font size variables and senior-friendly overrides
- **Focus States:** Implement 3px outline with 2px offset for accessibility

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Basic Functionality
- [ ] User can access the interface via dedicated HTML file
- [ ] Form accepts all required test requirement fields
- [ ] Form validation prevents submission with missing required fields
- [ ] Successfully collected requirements can be exported as JSON file
- [ ] Downloaded file follows timestamp naming convention

### AC-2: User Experience
- [ ] Interface matches existing platform visual design
- [ ] Form is intuitive for non-technical users
- [ ] Clear error messages guide users to correct issues
- [ ] Success feedback confirms successful export
- [ ] Interface works smoothly on both desktop and mobile

### AC-3: Accessibility

- [ ] Keyboard navigation works throughout the interface
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and consistent
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum 44px requirement
- [ ] High contrast mode is supported

### AC-4: Technical Standards
- [ ] Code follows existing project conventions
- [ ] No external dependencies introduced
- [ ] File structure matches project patterns
- [ ] JSON export format is valid and consistent
- [ ] Browser compatibility requirements are met

## Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- Users will download files manually rather than requiring automated storage
- Single-user session model is sufficient (no concurrent editing)
- JSON format is acceptable for stakeholder review and processing
- No server-side processing or database integration needed

### User Assumptions
- Target users are comfortable with basic web forms
- Users will manage downloaded files through their local file system
- Requirements will be reviewed and processed by technical team members
- Basic training on the interface usage is acceptable

### Business Assumptions
- File-based workflow fits into existing development processes
- No real-time collaboration features are needed initially
- Export functionality is sufficient for sharing requirements
- Integration with existing test frameworks is handled separately

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Import Functionality:** Allow importing previously exported requirements for editing
- **Template System:** Predefined templates for common test scenarios
- **Integration:** Future connection with project management tools
- **Collaboration:** Multi-user editing capabilities if needed
- **Reporting:** Summary views and requirement analysis features

### Maintenance Notes
- Monitor usage patterns to identify common requirement types
- Consider adding validation rules based on user feedback
- Evaluate accessibility compliance regularly
- Update UI patterns if platform design system evolves
