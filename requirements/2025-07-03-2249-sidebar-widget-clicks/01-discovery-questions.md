## Q1: Should the widgets navigate to separate dedicated pages instead of opening modals?
**Default if unknown:** No (current implementation uses modal system, changing to page navigation would require significant architectural changes)

**Default if unknown:** Yes (mobile-first is standard practice and widgets should be accessible on all devices)

**Default if unknown:** Yes (matching platform features typically require authenticated users for personalized content)

## Q4: Should the widgets maintain their current hover and animation effects when adding click navigation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (current visual feedback provides good user experience and shouldn't be disrupted)

## Q5: Will the navigation need to handle different user states (new users vs returning users)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (matching platforms typically show different content based on user progress and profile completion)
